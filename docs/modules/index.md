# Modules

Beyond the solver implementations, invertmeeg provides several supporting modules for simulation, evaluation, visualization, and benchmarking.

## Available Modules

### [Simulation](simulate.md)

Generate synthetic M/EEG data with configurable source activations, noise levels, and spatial patterns. Essential for validating inverse methods and running controlled experiments.

### [Evaluation](evaluate.md)

Metrics and tools for evaluating inverse solution quality, including localization error, spatial dispersion, and correlation measures.

### [Visualization](viz.md)

Plotting utilities for displaying source estimates, including glass brain views and surface plots.

### [Forward Modeling](forward.md)

Utilities for working with forward models, including leadfield manipulation and source space operations.

### [Benchmarking](benchmark.md)

Framework for systematically comparing solver performance across datasets and conditions.
